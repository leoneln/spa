import React, { Component } from "react";

class Onemore extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>So to create a new page do the following...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a file under src folder call the name of the component.. I
            this is called a compenent in react speak. For example File.js
          </li>
          <li>
            Inside the file File.js firs import react with this syntax.. import
            React, fdfjajdfaj from 'react'; This can be achieved very quickly by
            typing imrc a short cut that automatically fills in that import
            syntax..
          </li>
          <li>
            Then create a class File extends Component. Basically this a class
            that extendes the compenent whatever.. Inside the class you need a
            status, but for a simple page we are not using status. So skip this
            line.
          </li>
          <li>Next.... Wait, was next?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Onemore;
